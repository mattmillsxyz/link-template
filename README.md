# link-template
A generic HTML template for creating a minimal social link page.

A live example can be found at: https://mattmills.link

## Modify the template
1. Find all references to the word `CHANGE` in the template and update the content with your details.
2. The template currently contains 1 link button. To add more, simply copy/paste the entire link button section and change the url/text/image.
3. Update `avatar.jpg`. This is the image that displays at the top of the page.
4. Update `link-button-photo.jpg`. This is the small image that displays next to each link button. If you have multiple link buttons, you'll need to add a different image for each.

## Deployment
There are many ways to deploy this static HTML page. A couple of options are to:
1. Simply copy all of the files to a web server.
2. Fork this repository, and use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (this is how I host my page).
